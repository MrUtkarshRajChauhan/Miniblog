                Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that creates new content like text, images, code, or music by learning patterns from existing data.
                Instead of just analyzing information, it actually generates original outputs based on what it has learned.

            <p>
                Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across many computers so no single entity controls it.
                Once data is added to a block and confirmed, it becomes nearly impossible to change, making the system transparent and secure.

                Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses cryptography and runs on blockchain technology instead of being controlled by a bank or government.
                Transactions are verified by a decentralized network, making them transparent, secure, and borderless.
